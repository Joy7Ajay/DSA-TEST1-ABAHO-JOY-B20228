1.	In this step, we created two separate lists named catholic_martyrs and Anglican_martyrs to store the names of Catholic and Anglican martyrs, respectively. We populated these lists with the provided names of the martyrs. This step ensures that we have the necessary data to perform the subsequent tasks.
2.	In this step, we used the set() function to remove any duplicate names from both the catholic_martyrs  and anglican_martyrs lists. The set() function is a built-in Python data structure that only stores unique elements. By converting the lists to sets and then back to lists, we effectively remove any duplicate names. This step ensures that we have a clean and unique list of names for each group of martyrs.
3.	In this step, we defined a function named martyr_count  that takes in a martyr's name as an argument. Inside the function, we used conditional statements (if,elif,else ) to check if the name exists in either the catholic_martyrs  or anglican_martyrs list.
•	If the name is found in the catholic_martyrs  list, the function returns the string "Catholic". This indicates that the martyr belongs to the Catholic group.
•	If the name is found in the anglican_martyrs  list, the function returns the string "Anglican". This indicates that the martyr belongs to the Anglican group.
•	If the name is not found in either list, the function returns the string "Unknown". This indicates that the martyr's group could not be determined based on the provided name.
This function allows us to determine the group (Catholic or Anglican) to which a given martyr belongs based on their name.
4.	In this step, we called the martyr_count function with the name "Kizito" as an argument. This allows us to determine the group (Catholic or Anglican) to which the martyr named "Kizito" belongs. The result is stored in the martyr_group variable.
5.	In this step, we defined a Python function named is_uganda_martyr that takes in a name as an argument. Inside the function, we used the in operator to check if the name exists in both the catholic_martyrs  and anglican_martyrs lists.
•	If the name is found in both lists, the function returns True. This indicates that the name matches the names of the Uganda Martyrs in both lists.
•	If the name is not found in either list or only found in one list, the function returns False. This indicates that the name does not match the names of the Uganda Martyrs in both lists.
This function allows us to check if a given name matches the names of the Uganda Martyrs in both the Catholic and Anglican lists (according to how I understood the question.
